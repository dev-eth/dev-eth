## About me

Hi there. Thanks for visiting my profile. :)
I mainly use functional programming languages. Nevertheless, I'm not cynical about other programming languages and paradigms, even though I prefer the formalizable aspects, rather than the often subjective appeal to taste or intuition. 

### Other information

- Language: English
- Tech: React, Node, Angular, Javascript, Typescript, Python, AWS, ...
